1. pick a city
2. create a list of titles
3. use linkedin sales navigator to find people that currently or in the past had any of these titles in the city you selected
4. use free Skrapp to export csv list of contacts (do not need to get emails so this is free but you must go page by page which can be tedius but you only do it one time)
5. use http://merge-csv.com/ to merge all csv files into a single file
6. sort company column and remove duplicates
7. you now have a list of companies in your city that hire junior software engineers

Bonus: once you find a couple companies you really might like to work for, then you can contact a couple people on your list that work at those companies. You can use free Skrapp tool to search for their emails (up to 100). Then invite them to coffee or lunch and see if they are willing to speak with you of their experiences.
