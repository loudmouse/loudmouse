1. Create a `_drafts` folder in the root directory (one time setup)
2. Add a draft markdown file to this folder with any title ie. draft-001.markdown
3. Run the server with the flags to make these visible as previews ie. `jekyll server --watch --drafts`
4. When ready to publish, add date to file name and move to the `_posts` folder
